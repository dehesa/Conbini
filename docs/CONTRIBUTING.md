## Looking where to start

This repo's [Github projects](https://github.com/dehesa/Conbini/projects) are kept up to date and they are a good place to look if you don't know where to start.

-   The [_features_ project](https://github.com/dehesa/Conbini/projects/1) contains the features that are being worked on or it has been agreed to work on in the near future.

    Check the "Planned" column and pick a task.

-   The [_bugs_ project](https://github.com/dehesa/Conbini/projects/2) contains a list of known issues.

    Feel free to pick any.

-   The [_ideas_ project](https://github.com/dehesa/Conbini/projects/3) contains a list of suggestions or future plans that haven't been properly investigated.

    These are a bit more "futuristics" and many of them may never be undertook. However, they are worth exploring.
