# Getting help

Here is a helpful list of "where to get help" depending on the topic:

-   **How to use Conbini?**

    The first place to look is the [README file](https://github.com/dehesa/Conbini/blob/master/README.md). It is kept updated and there is a wealth of information under each right-pointing [caret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret).

    You can also look for issues labeled as [question](https://github.com/dehesa/Conbini/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion+). Odds are your question has been asked before.

    If the information is not there, feel free to create a [new issue](https://github.com/dehesa/Conbini/issues/new) labeling it as _question_.

-   **How to use Swift's [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)?**

    There are many places to learn how to use Combine.

    -   [Apple's Article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/receiving_and_handling_events_with_combine) on receiving and handling events with Combine.
    -   Ray Wenderlich's [Combine book](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/combine-asynchronous-programming-with-swift).

    For complex queries, go to the [Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org), specifically the [_Using Swift_](https://forums.swift.org/c/swift-users/15) category, setting the search tag to [_combine_](https://forums.swift.org/tags/c/swift-users/15/combine).

-   **How to contribute to Conbini?**

    This project uses the standard [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file explaining the contribution guidelines. This same file also has a section on "where to start contributing", in case you want to contribute but you are unsure where to start.

    Also take a look at the Github's [projects page](https://github.com/dehesa/Conbini/projects) where you can see the project's Kanban board.

-   **Problems with Github**.

    Check their [fantastic documentation](https://help.github.com/en), go to [Github's learning lab](https://lab.github.com), or ask [Github support](https://support.github.com).
